"""Command registry — structured routing entries for the tool hint planner.

Each entry describes a category of user intent and the actionable hint to
surface. Hint templates use {misc_path} and {instance}, resolved at call
time via resolve_command_registry().

Mirrors core/command-registry.ts. Eventually built programmatically from
datastore plugin contracts; for now a static list.
