# Governance

Quaid is currently maintainer-led.

## Decision Process

- Day-to-day decisions are made by maintainers.
- Significant architectural changes should include rationale in docs and tests.
- Public discussion happens in GitHub issues/PRs.

## Contribution Model

- Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
- Maintainers review for correctness, scope fit, and operational safety.
- Experimental features may be merged behind clear labeling when useful.

## Evolution

As the contributor base grows, this governance model may evolve to include broader maintainer roles and more formal RFC/ADR process.
