# AI Install Guide

This guide is for AI agents running Quaid installation on behalf of a human.

## Human Instructions for Agent (Copy/Paste)

Use this exact flow when asking an AI agent to install Quaid:

1. Read `docs/AI-INSTALL.md` first and follow it exactly.
2. Before running any install command, show me a pre-install survey with all chosen options (including defaults).
3. Ask me to approve or change the survey answers.
4. Only after my approval, run install.
5. After install, report a full summary of the final selected options.

The pre-install survey is mandatory for all AI/agent installs, including `--agent` mode.

## Source of Truth for Prompt Flow

Before running install, read the installer file directly:

- `setup-quaid.mjs`

That file defines:

- Which questions/prompts are asked
- Which defaults are used
- Which flags/env vars alter behavior
- Which fields belong in the human pre-install survey

If an agent needs to predict prompts or run non-interactively, it should use `setup-quaid.mjs` as the canonical reference.
In particular, agents should follow the `AGENT_SURVEY_CONTRACT` block in that file.

Do not maintain a separate survey template in agent memory.
Do not infer survey sections from internal installer functions.
If `setup-quaid.mjs` changes, the survey must change with it.

## Recommended Entry Point

Use the Node installer directly instead of `curl | bash` when an agent is driving install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quaid-labs/quaid.git
cd quaid
node setup-quaid.mjs --agent --workspace "/absolute/path/to/workspace" --owner-name "<Person Name>"
```

`--workspace` is the safest way to avoid wrong workspace detection in non-interactive sessions.
`--owner-name` ensures memory ownership is tagged to the human (not a system account).

## Canary / Private Test Installs (No Public Release Required)

For pre-release validation, install directly from a branch or commit SHA:

```bash
node setup-quaid.mjs --agent \
  --workspace "/absolute/path/to/workspace" \
  --owner-name "<Person Name>" \
  --source github \
  --ref canary
```

Pin to an exact commit for reproducible tests:

```bash
node setup-quaid.mjs --agent \
  --workspace "/absolute/path/to/workspace" \
  --owner-name "<Person Name>" \
  --source github \
  --ref <commit-sha>
```

Artifact fallback (local file path or URL to a `.tar.gz` canary package):

```bash
node setup-quaid.mjs --agent \
  --workspace "/absolute/path/to/workspace" \
  --owner-name "<Person Name>" \
  --source artifact \
  --artifact "/path/to/quaid-plugin-<sha>.tar.gz"
```

## Environment Variables (optional)

- `QUAID_WORKSPACE` or `QUAID_HOME`: explicit workspace override
- `CLAWDBOT_WORKSPACE`: OpenClaw workspace hint
- `QUAID_INSTALL_AGENT=1`: enable non-interactive installer defaults
- `QUAID_OWNER_NAME`: explicit human owner name for memory tagging
- `QUAID_INSTALL_SOURCE`: `local|github|artifact`
- `QUAID_INSTALL_REF`: git branch/tag/commit (for github source)
- `QUAID_INSTALL_GITHUB_REPO`: repo override (default `quaid-labs/quaid`)
- `QUAID_INSTALL_ARTIFACT`: local path or URL to `.tar.gz` (for artifact source)
- `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY=0|1`: disable/enable installer progress notifications in agent mode
- `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_PROGRESS=0|1`: disable/enable step checkpoint notifications
- `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_COMPLETE=0|1`: disable/enable completion notification
- `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_CHANNEL`: force installer progress channel (for example `telegram`)
- `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_TARGET`: force installer progress target (for example `telegram:<chat_id>`)
- `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_ACCOUNT`: optional channel account override when using explicit channel/target

## OpenClaw-specific Notes

- Installer now attempts to auto-heal missing `agents.list` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
- Required hooks are enabled explicitly during install:
  - `bootstrap-extra-files` (alias fallback: `bot-strap-extra-files`)
  - `session-memory` (alias fallback: `session-memoey`)

## Minimal Non-interactive Command

```bash
QUAID_WORKSPACE="/absolute/path/to/workspace" QUAID_OWNER_NAME="<Person Name>" QUAID_INSTALL_AGENT=1 node setup-quaid.mjs --agent
```

## Optional Dry Context Step for Agents

If an agent wants to inspect expected flow before running:

```bash
node setup-quaid.mjs --help
```

Then inspect `setup-quaid.mjs` for step prompts/defaults and execute the non-interactive command above.

## Agent Communication Requirement (Mandatory)

Before running install, the AI agent must run a short pre-install survey with the human.

Show all planned answers (including defaults) and ask: "Do you want to change any of these before I run install?"

The list of required survey fields lives in `setup-quaid.mjs` under `AGENT_SURVEY_CONTRACT`.
Agents must derive the survey from that contract instead of reproducing a second field list here.

### Model Selection Guidance (Mandatory)

When discussing model choices with the user, explain the two-tier roles first:

- `Fast reasoning model`: cheaper/faster path for routing, reranking, and lightweight classification.
- `Deep reasoning model`: higher-quality path for extraction, review, and heavier synthesis work.

For supported provider lanes (Anthropic/OpenAI), Quaid provides suggested model defaults. In that case:

- include those deep/fast defaults in the pre-install survey
- let the user override if they want
- no extra model-selection discussion is required

### Notification Routing Guidance (Mandatory)

For OpenClaw installs, do not leave Quaid runtime notifications on implicit `last_used` during install.
The installer or agent should pin Quaid notifications to an explicit OpenClaw channel based on the active user route.

- include the planned notification routing channel in the pre-install survey
- if installer progress needs explicit delivery, set:
  - `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_CHANNEL`
  - `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_TARGET`
  - optionally `QUAID_INSTALL_NOTIFY_ACCOUNT`
- for Telegram-driven installs, the expected runtime channel is usually `telegram`
- the adapter is responsible for resolving that channel to the proper recent session target at send time

If the active OpenClaw user route cannot be determined, the agent must say so clearly before install instead of pretending notifications are guaranteed.

If the user is using an unsupported provider/model lane for their gateway (for example Gemini, Kimi/K2.5, or other custom routes), Quaid does not provide suggested fast/deep defaults. In that case the agent must:

- tell the user manual fast/deep model selection is required
- discuss budget, latency, and quality tradeoffs briefly
- collect explicit deep and fast model IDs from the user before install

Only execute install after the user confirms or edits these values.
This is mandatory even when using `--agent` non-interactive mode.

For long-running installs, the agent must send a brief progress update before backgrounding:
"Install is running and may take 1-2 minutes; I'll report back when complete."

### Completion Notification (Mandatory)

Do not rely only on one long blocking process poll to detect completion.
On some runtimes (notably OpenClaw + Telegram), long polls can fail silently and the user receives no completion message.

Use one of these patterns:

- `Option A (recommended for OpenClaw/Telegram)`: run install in background, append `EXIT:<code>` to a log, and poll the log in short intervals. Send a channel message as soon as `EXIT:` appears.
- `Option B`: use short (15-20s) poll loops and explicitly post a completion summary when the process exits.

Never:

- Use a single blocking poll longer than 30s on Telegram/OpenClaw surfaces.
- Go silent after backgrounding.
- Assume polling wake-up is guaranteed across runtimes.

For embeddings specifically: agents must not silently default to degraded mode when Ollama is unavailable.
They must ask the user whether to install/start Ollama first, and only proceed degraded after explicit approval.

### macOS Memory Reporting Note

On macOS, installer RAM availability is estimated from `vm_stat` pages (`free + inactive + speculative + purgeable`), not just strictly free pages.
This can differ from Activity Monitor's displayed "free" number, and may differ from what users expect when cache/compression is active.
Agents should state which memory metric they used in the survey and confirm with the user before choosing a lower-tier embedding model.

When an AI agent runs install, it must explicitly report all selected options to the user, including values that were defaults.

Do not say only "install succeeded." Always include a compact options summary so the user can see what was chosen and what can be changed later.

Minimum required summary fields:

- Owner (`users.defaultOwner`)
- Adapter type (`adapter.type`)
- LLM provider (`models.llmProvider`) and selected deep/fast models (`models.deepReasoning`, `models.fastReasoning`)
- Notification settings (`notifications.level`, plus `notifications.janitor|extraction|retrieval.verbosity`)
- Notification routing channel (`notifications.<feature>.channel`)
- Embedding provider/model (`models.embeddingsProvider`, `ollama.embeddingModel`)
- Janitor apply mode/policies (`janitor.applyMode`, `janitor.approvalPolicies.*`)
- Janitor schedule choice (or explicit "not scheduled")

The summary should also tell the user where to edit settings:

- Interactive editor: `quaid config edit`
- Config file: `<workspace>/config/memory.json`

Do not present `memory`, `journal`, `projects`, or `workspace` as a survey field or configurable install choice.
Those systems are always on by policy and should only be described if the user explicitly asks.

## Verification

After install:

```bash
openclaw hooks list
openclaw hooks enable bootstrap-extra-files
openclaw hooks enable session-memory
```

If OpenClaw is unavailable, run standalone mode and set workspace via `--workspace`.
