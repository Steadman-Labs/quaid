# Quaid v0.20.0-alpha Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-21

## Summary
v0.20.0-alpha marks a major architecture milestone: Quaid is now organized around adapter/provider boundaries so core memory logic stays host- and provider-agnostic, while runtime-specific auth/model routing is handled at the edges.

This is an **alpha** release intended for real testing and early contributors, not a fully hardened production release.

## Highlights
- Adapter/provider routing stabilized around deep/fast reasoning tiers.
- OpenClaw integration path significantly hardened (`/compact`, `/new`, `/reset`, `/restart`, timeout extraction flow).
- Deterministic + integration + e2e harnesses established.
- Bootstrap/runtime workflow split from clean dev source workflow.
- E2E automation now defaults to quiet notification behavior to avoid channel spam.

## Known Limitations (Alpha)
- Parallel session targeting around reset/new extraction still has edge cases.
- Multi-user behavior is partially supported but not fully hardened for heavy concurrent use.
- Windows support exists but is not deeply operationally tested yet.
- OpenClaw is currently the most mature host integration; broader host coverage is in progress.

## Validation Snapshot
- Focused regression group after latest fixes:
  - `137 passed` (`test_mcp_integration.py`, `test_providers.py`, `test_soul_snippets.py`)
- Long-tail runtime sweep (bounded per-file):
  - Top slow files include `tests/test_beam_search.py` and `tests/test_golden_recall.py`
  - No timeouts/failures in bounded per-file pass.

## Upgrade Notes
- If you run bootstrap/e2e automation, pull latest `~/quaid/bootstrap` scripts to get quiet-notification defaults.
- Keep local credentials in bootstrap local profile files only (`profiles/*.local*.json`, gitignored).

## Next Priorities
- Parallel-session-safe extraction targeting.
- Additional host adapters (Codex-style and Claude Code-style runtimes).
- Code-focused operating mode (“code mode”).
- Release hardening and provider-matrix gating.
