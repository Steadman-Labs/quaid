# Quaid v0.20.0-alpha

Release date: 2026-02-22

## Summary

v0.20.0-alpha is the architecture-stabilization release for adapter/core separation, provider/model routing, extraction signaling reliability, and operational test flow.

## Highlights

- Adapter/provider model routing with separate `deep` and `fast` reasoning tiers.
- OpenClaw adapter hardening for `/new`, `/reset`, `/compact`, timeout extraction signaling.
- Session message-log extraction flow restored and stabilized.
- Delayed request plumbing for janitor/escalation workflows (adapter-owned queue path).
- Installer and config UX updates, including advanced setup and interactive config editing.
- Test infrastructure refresh (unit/integration partitioning + adapter-specific lanes + bootstrap e2e matrix path).

## Notifications and Janitor

- Feature-level notification controls (`janitor`, `extraction`, `retrieval`) are now the primary model.
- Recommended `normal` behavior: janitor summary, extraction summary, retrieval off.
- Janitor health warnings route through delayed adapter requests (not noisy per-turn extraction spam).

## Known Limitations

- Parallel-session targeting for `/new` and `/reset` extraction has edge cases.
- Multi-user and heavy-concurrency workloads need more soak testing.
- Windows support exists but has less runtime coverage than macOS/Linux.
- OpenClaw is the most mature host integration path; other host adapters are planned.

## Upgrade Notes

- Re-run installer or config editor to align notification schema defaults:
  - `quaid config edit`
- If using OpenClaw, ensure HEARTBEAT includes delayed request processing guidance.

## Validation

Recommended local validation for this release:

```bash
cd plugins/quaid
npm run test:all
npm run test:all:full
```

Optional (host/runtime):

```bash
~/quaid/bootstrap/scripts/run-quaid-e2e-matrix.sh
```
