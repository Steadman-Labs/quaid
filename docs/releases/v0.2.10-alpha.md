# Quaid v0.2.10-alpha

## Highlights

- Added gateway LLM fallback when `/plugins/quaid/llm` is unavailable (`404`/`405`).
- `GatewayLLMProvider` now retries through gateway OpenResponses at `/v1/responses`.
- Added regression coverage for:
  - 405 fallback from plugin LLM route to OpenResponses.
  - model resolution from workspace `config/memory.json` during fallback.

## Notes

- This release unblocks installs where the host gateway does not mount the plugin LLM HTTP route.
- OpenClaw hook eligibility gating bug (`disabled` treated as `ineligible`) remains an upstream OpenClaw issue.
