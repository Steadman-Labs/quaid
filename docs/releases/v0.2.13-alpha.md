# Quaid v0.2.13-alpha

## Highlights

- Installer now registers Quaid through OpenClaw plugin lifecycle commands:
  - `openclaw plugins install <path>`
  - `openclaw plugins enable quaid`
- Installer now restarts gateway after plugin registration so the plugin is active immediately.
- Installer now removes stale invalid config key `plugins.entries.quaid.workspace` from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
- Installer now enforces `agents.defaults.compaction.mode = "default"` in OpenClaw config.

## Notes

- This release fixes the common state where Quaid appeared enabled in config but was not actually loadable by OpenClaw.
- If upgrading an existing install, run the installer again to apply config cleanup and plugin registration.
