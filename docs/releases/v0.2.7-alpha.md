# Quaid v0.2.7-alpha

## Highlights

- Added explicit project-registration notifications:
  - `project_create` now sends a user notification on successful project creation.
  - Notification is controlled by per-item toggle `notifications.projectCreate.enabled` (or `notifications.project_create.enabled`).
  - Default is enabled.
- Notification dispatch is independent of legacy notification verbosity levels so project registration events are still surfaced at low-noise settings.
- Installer defaults now include:
  - `"notifications": { "projectCreate": { "enabled": true } }`
- Added config hardening:
  - Non-dict values for `notifications.project_create` / `notifications.projectCreate` are handled safely during config load.

## Notes

- This release is scoped to notification behavior and install/config defaults.
- Runtime retrieval, extraction, and janitor logic are unchanged by this patch.
