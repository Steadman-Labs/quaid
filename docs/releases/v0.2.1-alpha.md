# Quaid v0.2.1-alpha

Release date: 2026-02-27

## Summary

v0.2.1-alpha focuses on hardening and contract cleanup after the 0.2.0 architecture split.

## Highlights

- Documentation contract alignment:
  - janitor task ordering/surface corrected (including `graduate` + `update_check`)
  - benchmark paths and benchmark claims normalized
  - provider/model tier naming standardized (`deep` / `fast`)
- Memory retrieval and extraction docs aligned to runtime:
  - chunked extraction behavior documented instead of single-call wording
  - fusion/intent and scoring descriptions corrected (including `RELATION`/`PROJECT` intent mappings)
- Interface/docs cleanup:
  - MCP/OpenClaw tool surfaces clarified
  - event contract docs updated to include all registered built-in events
  - stale/phantom module paths removed across architecture and decision docs
- Operational runbooks tightened:
  - release/checklist and contributing command paths corrected
  - benchmark operations docs now include explicit working-directory context

## Known Limitations

- Parallel-session targeting for `/new` and `/reset` extraction still has edge cases.
- Multi-user and heavy-concurrency workloads need more soak testing.
- Windows support exists but has less runtime coverage than macOS/Linux.
- OpenClaw remains the most mature host integration path.

## Upgrade Notes

- Re-run config/editor flow to pick up current defaults and key names:
  - `quaid config edit`
- For benchmark lanes, use the working-directory conventions in `docs/BENCHMARK-OPERATIONS.md` to avoid path mismatches.

## Validation

Recommended local validation:

```bash
cd modules/quaid
npm run build:runtime
npm run test:all
npm run test:all:full
```
