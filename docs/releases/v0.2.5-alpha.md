# Quaid v0.2.5-alpha

## Highlights

- Installer hardening for AI-assisted installs:
  - Added `--agent` mode support for non-interactive defaults in `setup-quaid.mjs` and `setup-quaid.sh`
  - Added `--workspace` override support to explicitly target the correct workspace
- Workspace detection improvements:
  - Added fallback workspace detection from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` in install paths
  - Added `QUAID_WORKSPACE` environment override in `install.sh`
- OpenClaw onboarding resilience:
  - Installer now attempts to auto-heal missing `agents.list` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
  - If recovery fails, installer continues with a clear warning instead of an opaque hard stop
- New documentation:
  - Added `docs/AI-INSTALL.md` with recommended AI/agent install workflow

## Notes

- This release is installer/config UX focused; runtime behavior is unchanged.
- Required OpenClaw hooks remain explicitly enabled with alias fallbacks:
  - `bootstrap-extra-files` (`bot-strap-extra-files`)
  - `session-memory` (`session-memoey`)
