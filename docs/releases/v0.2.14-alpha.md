# Quaid v0.2.14-alpha

## Highlights

- Installer now waits for OpenClaw gateway/plugin route warmup before LLM-dependent install steps.
- Installer migration import now degrades gracefully on transient gateway/LLM startup errors instead of aborting the whole migration step.
- Installer smoke test now treats transient startup failures as best-effort partial outcomes during initial gateway startup windows.
- Added warmup checks after installer-triggered gateway restarts (plugin registration and responses endpoint enable).

## Notes

- This release fixes install-time race conditions where `Connection refused` during early plugin-route startup could look like a hard failure.
- Existing installs remain valid; this primarily improves first-install reliability and messaging.
