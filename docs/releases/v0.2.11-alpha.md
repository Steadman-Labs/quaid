# Quaid v0.2.11-alpha

## Highlights

- Hardened OpenClaw gateway install flow for agent-driven installs.
- Installer now ensures `gateway.http.endpoints.responses.enabled=true` and attempts a gateway restart.
- Added resilient hook-enable fallback:
  - Tries CLI hook enable first
  - Force-enables required hooks in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` when CLI eligibility checks fail
  - Restarts gateway when forced changes are applied
- Gateway Python provider now auto-resolves gateway auth token from:
  - `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
  - `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (`gateway.auth.mode=token`)
- Updated installer owner identity behavior:
  - Explicit human-name prompt for owner tagging
  - Added `--owner-name` / `QUAID_OWNER_NAME` support for non-interactive mode
- Improved sqlite-vec install fallback sequence (`python3 -m pip`, `--user`, `pip3`, `pip`).
- Workspace-file import defaults are now opt-in friendly in agent installs (default `true`).
- Updated AI install documentation to require a pre-install option survey and explicit option summary.

## Notes

- OpenClaw CLI hook eligibility logic can still misreport disabled hooks as ineligible in some builds; installer now applies a config-level fallback.
- Plugin-surface empty-export warnings are unchanged in this release.
