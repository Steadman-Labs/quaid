# Quaid v0.2.9-alpha

## Highlights

- Fixed additional plugin contract startup blockers caused by duplicate declared exports across active plugins.
- Cleared duplicate declarations on:
  - `auth_requirements` (`openclaw.adapter` vs `core.extract`)
  - `events` / `ingest_triggers` (`docsdb.core` / `notedb.core` vs `core.extract`)
  - `notifications` (`openclaw.adapter` vs `core.extract` / `docsdb.core`)
- Added repository-level regression coverage to prevent recurrence:
  - `test_repo_manifests_have_no_duplicate_declared_exports`
  - Scans real `modules/quaid/**/plugin.json` manifests and fails on any duplicate declared export across contract surfaces.

## Notes

- This release follows v0.2.8-alpha and focuses on plugin manifest contract safety and startup reliability for fresh installs.
- No behavioral changes to extraction logic beyond resolving manifest ownership conflicts.
