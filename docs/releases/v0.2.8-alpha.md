# Quaid v0.2.8-alpha

## Highlights

- Fixed installer/runtime blocker where plugin contracts failed to load with:
  - `ValueError: Duplicate declared ingest_triggers export 'compaction' across active plugins: core.extract, openclaw.adapter`
- `core.extract` remains the sole owner of ingest trigger exports:
  - `timeout`, `compaction`, `reset`, `manual`
- `openclaw.adapter` no longer declares ingest triggers, eliminating contract export collisions during startup and smoke tests.

## Notes

- This release is a focused hotfix for plugin contract compatibility in fresh installs.
- Extraction behavior and trigger handling are unchanged beyond removing duplicate declaration ownership.
