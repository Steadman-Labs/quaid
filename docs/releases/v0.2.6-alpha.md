# Quaid v0.2.6-alpha

## Highlights

- Installer follow-up hardening for AI/agent installs:
  - `--agent` mode no longer performs automatic package installs
  - `waitForKey()` is skipped in agent mode to avoid tmux/non-interactive hangs
  - Robust `--workspace` argument validation in shell installer
  - `QUAID_WORKSPACE` support added to `setup-quaid.mjs`
- Safety and correctness improvements:
  - Unknown/malformed installer args now fail fast with clear errors
  - Agent-mode text inputs now respect validator callbacks
  - OpenClaw config healing writes are atomic (`tmp + rename`)
  - Non-standard non-empty `agents.list` is preserved (no destructive overwrite)
  - File-based fallback verification added when OpenClaw CLI is unavailable
- Environment priority normalized across installers:
  - `--workspace` > `QUAID_WORKSPACE` > `QUAID_HOME` > `CLAWDBOT_WORKSPACE`

## Notes

- Release includes previous `v0.2.5-alpha` installer UX improvements plus blocker fixes found in deep review.
- Runtime memory logic is unchanged; this release is installer and install-flow hardening.
