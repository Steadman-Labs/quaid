# Quaid v0.2.3-alpha

Release date: 2026-03-01

## Summary

v0.2.3-alpha focuses on contract hardening, domain system reliability, and lifecycle scheduler resilience.

## Highlights

- Plugin contract system hardening:
  - stricter manifest/runtime validation across declared surfaces
  - improved strict vs non-strict behavior with clearer diagnostics
  - stronger adapter/MCP declaration parity checks for tools and API routes
- Domain architecture stabilization:
  - memorydb domain registry is authoritative
  - domain list/tooling sync moved to safer runtime and installer paths
  - extraction and recall domain error contracts tightened
  - support for domain boost controls in recall flows
- Lifecycle parallelism improvements:
  - global adaptive LLM scheduler retries/backoff behavior corrected
  - timeout/cancellation handling made safer under contention
  - worker scoping and prepass scheduling behavior aligned with config
- Installer and ops reliability:
  - improved gateway/plugin path handling
  - more robust sqlite-vec and environment handling in setup flows
  - release/test/doc checks tightened

## Known Limitations

- OpenClaw remains the most mature host path; non-OpenClaw MCP client behavior can still vary.
- Heavy-concurrency and multi-user workloads still need continued soak testing.
- Domain registration governance is available, but policy defaults should be reviewed per deployment.
- Windows support exists but has less runtime coverage than macOS/Linux.

## Upgrade Notes

- Re-run installer/config flows to pick up the latest defaults and contract validations:
  - `node setup-quaid.mjs` or `bash setup-quaid.sh`
  - `quaid config edit`
- If you use custom domain workflows, verify active registry state post-upgrade:
  - `memory_domain_list`

## Validation

Recommended local validation:

```bash
cd modules/quaid
npm run build:runtime
npm run test:all
npm run test:all:full
```
