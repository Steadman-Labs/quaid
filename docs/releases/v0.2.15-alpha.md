# Quaid v0.2.15-alpha

## Highlights

- Fixed OpenClaw hook-enable timing race by waiting for gateway warmup before enabling required hooks.
- Hook force-enable warnings now include the underlying CLI error details for easier diagnosis.
- Installer now ensures `plugins.allow` includes `quaid` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to prevent repeated plugin-allow warnings.
- Improved install messaging:
  - Legacy `quaid-reset-signal` hook message now explicitly says no action is required.
  - Quaid project doc registration log now avoids misleading `0 docs registered` output when docs were already indexed in an earlier pass.

## Notes

- This release is installer-focused and targets first-install reliability, observability, and cleaner OpenClaw integration output.
