# MEMORY.md Guidance (Quaid)

Purpose: guide journaling entries that belong in shared-moments/world-understanding memory.

## What Belongs
- High-signal moments with emotional or narrative weight.
- Shared context that explains arc, continuity, or trust.
- Pattern-level world understanding that emerged from repeated moments.

## What Does Not Belong
- User profile details that belong in USER.md.
- Agent identity reflections that belong in SOUL.md.
- Rule-like instructions.

## Writing Standard
- Prefer vivid, concrete scenes over sterile summaries.
- Preserve why the moment mattered.
- Keep entries concise enough to distill over time.

## Canonical Principle
- Moments are learned in context; do not flatten them into brittle rules.
