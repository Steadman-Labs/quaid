# Project: Quaid

## Purpose
Quaid is an active knowledge layer for agentic systems. It captures personal facts and project context, recalls them with hybrid search, keeps documentation current through project-aware indexing, and maintains knowledge health via nightly janitor maintenance. Supports multiple adapters (OpenClaw, Claude Code) sharing a single QUAID_HOME on the same machine.

This file is the canonical entry point for all docs in `projects/quaid`.

## Core Runtime Docs

| File | Summary |
|---|---|
| `projects/quaid/AGENTS.md` | Runtime operating guide for the agent: three-layer memory model, when to use memory tools, and extraction behavior. |
| `projects/quaid/TOOLS.md` | Runtime tool-usage guide: what to call, when to call it, practical recall patterns, project commands, and domain filter map. |
| `projects/quaid/CONSTITUTION.md` | Philosophical and architectural constitution for Quaid’s core files and evolution model. |
| `projects/quaid/SOUL.md` | Guidance for what belongs in SOUL journaling and how entries should be written. |
| `projects/quaid/USER.md` | Guidance for user-understanding journaling (patterns, sensitivity, tone boundaries). |
| `projects/quaid/MEMORY.md` | Guidance for shared-moment/world-understanding journaling entries. |

## Technical Reference Docs

| File | Summary |
|---|---|
| `projects/quaid/reference/adapter-provider-architecture.md` | **Stub — folded into `docs/INTERFACES.md#provider-abstraction-contract`.** Provider abstraction contract: only adapter/provider + config are provider-aware; core calls deep/fast tiers only. |

| `projects/quaid/reference/memory-system-design.md` | **Stub — moved to memory-reference.md.** |
| `projects/quaid/reference/memory-local-implementation.md` | **Stub — moved to memory-reference.md.** |
| `projects/quaid/reference/memory-schema.md` | **Stub — moved to memory-reference.md.** |
| `projects/quaid/reference/memory-deduplication-system.md` | Store-time and janitor dedup pipeline, thresholds, and merge safety behavior. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/janitor-reference.md` | Nightly janitor pipeline reference: schedule, tasks, 3-pass RAG reindex, locking, and operational behavior. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/memory-operations-guide.md` | Operational handbook for memory/docs lifecycle and day-to-day usage. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/projects-cli-reference.md` | Stub — see projects-reference.md. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/extraction-pipeline.md` | **New.** Full extraction pipeline reference: triggers, signal protocol, 14-step pipeline, all 7 hooks, daemon lifecycle, public API. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/config-instances.md` | **New.** Config system and instance model: 4-layer merge chain, per-instance layout, shared state, CLI reference, multi-instance patterns. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/projects-system.md` | Stub — see projects-reference.md. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/projects-reference.md` | **Consolidated.** Projects system: overview, two-registry model, full lifecycle, shadow git, sync engine, project updater, CLI reference, cross-instance workflow, invariants. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/rag-docs-system.md` | **New.** RAG and docs system: indexing pipeline, chunking, search, staleness detection, doc auto-update, event processing, CLI reference. |
| `projects/quaid/reference/hooks-session-lifecycle.md` | **New.** Hook entry points and session lifecycle: all 7 hooks with stdin/stdout schemas, CC/OC hook wiring, signal system, subagent registry, notification model. |

## Operations & Testing Docs

| File | Summary |
|---|---|
| `projects/quaid/operations/project_onboarding.md` | Agent workflow for project discovery, registration, cross-instance participation (link/unlink), and safe deletion. |
