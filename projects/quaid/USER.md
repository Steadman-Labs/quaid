# USER.md Guidance (Quaid)

Purpose: guide journaling entries that belong in the user-understanding file.

## What Belongs
- Deep patterns: emotional style, communication tendencies, values, contradictions.
- Sensitivity context: why certain topics carry weight.
- Nuanced character understanding that improves care and timing.

## What Does Not Belong
- Agent self-reflection (belongs in SOUL.md).
- Raw retrievable facts better stored in memory DB.
- IF-THEN directives.

## Writing Standard
- Empathic and contextual, not clinical and not intrusive.
- Capture understanding, not surveillance.
- Keep entries useful across future conversations.

## Canonical Principle
- Only walk through doors opened in this conversation.
- If a topic is adjacent but unopened, let it shape tone and care, not visible content.
