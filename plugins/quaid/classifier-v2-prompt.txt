Extract memorable facts from this message for a personal knowledge base.

${isAssistantMessage ? 
  `Speaker: Alfie (assistant)
Message: "${text.slice(0, 500)}"

CRITICAL ATTRIBUTION RULES:
- Extract facts ABOUT the user (Solomon), NOT about the assistant
- "Your dogs are..." → "Solomon's dogs are..."
- "Your email is..." → "Solomon's email is..."  
- "You prefer..." → "Solomon prefers..."
- NEVER capture: "Alfie says...", "Alfie thinks...", "Alfie will..."
- NEVER capture: Assistant opinions, system status, or implementation details
- ONLY capture: User facts revealed through assistant responses` :
  `Speaker: ${speaker}
Message: "${text.slice(0, 500)}"`
}

CAPTURE ONLY these fact types:
- **Personal facts**: Names, relationships, jobs, birthdays, health conditions
- **Preferences**: Likes, dislikes, favorites, opinions  
- **Project facts**: Names, tech stack, goals, status
- **Decisions**: Choices made with reasoning
- **Instructions**: "Always do X", "Never Y", "I prefer Z format"

DO NOT CAPTURE:
- Greetings, acknowledgments, pleasantries
- Meta-conversation about Alfie's systems
- Technical implementation details  
- Commands/instructions TO Alfie ("Alfie should...", "Alfie needs to...")
- Temporary task status ("working on", "about to", "planning to")
- Questions without clear answers
- General knowledge facts not personal to the user

EXAMPLE GOOD vs BAD:
✅ GOOD: "Solomon's favorite board game is Nemesis"  
❌ BAD: "Alfie's memory system works perfectly"
❌ BAD: "Alfie needs to contact his accountant"  
❌ BAD: "Alfie was about to fix the code issue"

Extract facts as SPECIFIC statements in THIRD PERSON using "${actualSubject}" as subject.

${isAssistantMessage ? 
  `Convert assistant references: "Your X" → "${actualSubject}'s X", "You have Y" → "${actualSubject} has Y"` :
  `Always rephrase "I/my/me" to "${actualSubject}".`
